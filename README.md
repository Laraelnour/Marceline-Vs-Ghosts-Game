# Marceline-Vs-Ghosts-VisualStudio
A simple game where Marceline from Adventure Time goes on an adventure where she has to shoot ghosts with lasers from her guitar to win points.

This game is a creative exploration of a game created in workshops with Sumo Digital. 
The original game can be found on my profile under the name 'Space-Adventure_-Sumo-Digital_-Visual-Studio'.
Drawings and Characters have been created by Lara Abouelnour.
Audios used have been taken from other sources. Those sources are mentioned throughout the code.

Unfortunately, the files are too many to include on GitHub, however feel free to checkout the 'Marceline Vs Ghost Game.mp4' video attached instead. 
Do not hesistate to contact me if you wish to be sent the files.

Thank you,
Lara

Future updates shall explore further improvement of the game, such as 'getting hurt' when colliding with a ghost and introducing a boss level, as well as bug fixes.
